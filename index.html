			<p>The <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/whole.html#DLM64785" target="_blank">Official Information Act</a> (OIA) is a very important law that gives you and me a lot of power. What it says, essentially, is simple:</p>

			<p><em>If you ask the government for information, they have to give it to you.</em></p>

			<p>At the heart of the OIA is its <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/whole.html#DLM65365" target="_blank">Principle of Availability</a>:</p>

			<blockquote>information shall be made available unless there is good reason for withholding it.</blockquote>

			<p>The details of the OIA lay out exactly what counts legally as a "good reason" to withhold information, and other specifics like how quickly an agency must respond and how complaints are handled.</p>

			<p>It's a powerful tool, but most people don't realise they have this power or understand how they can use it. If you feel you might need to read the legislation first, it can feel pretty daunting. But <em>you don't need to read the OIA before you can use the OIA</em>.</p>

			<p>This document is both a guide and a reference for OIA users. You can read it in full, or just refer to the sections you need. <span class="tooltip" tabindex="0" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="tooltip-example-trigger" aria-describedby="tooltip-example-body"><span class="tooltip__trigger" id="tooltip-example-trigger">Highlighted text</span><span class="tooltip__body" id="tooltip-example-body">Click on the green text to make this info box stick around.</span></span> can be clicked on to see more information, and <span class="a">underlined text</span> links to relevant parts of the law, example requests, and guidance notes.</p>

			<p>There's also a similar law, the <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1987/0174/latest/whole.html#DLM122242" target="_blank">Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act (LGOIMA)</a>. It's essentially the same as the OIA, but applies to local government bodies.</p>

						<p><a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/whole.html#DLM65382" target="_blank">Section 12</a> of the OIA explains who can make a request. This is a very permissive section.</p>

						<h4>Are you in New Zealand?</h4>

						<p>If you are, you can use the OIA.</p>

						<h4>Are you a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident?</h4>

						<p>If you are, you can use the OIA even if you're not in New Zealand.</p>

						<h4>None of the above?</h4>

						<p>You aren't eligible under the OIA, but that doesn't mean you can't ask for information.
							<span class="tooltip" tabindex="0" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="tooltip-ineligible-answer-trigger" aria-describedby="tooltip-ineligible-answer-body">
								<span class="tooltip__trigger" id="tooltip-ineligible-answer-trigger">Agencies can still choose to answer your request</span>.
								<span class="tooltip__body" id="tooltip-ineligible-answer-body">
									<span class="p">The Ombudsman's guidance on <a href="http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/1605/original/the_oia_for_agencies.doc.pdf?1466730917" target="_blank">the OIA for Ministers and agencies</a> asks the question "What if a requester is not eligible". Here's what it says:</span>

									<span class="blockquote">
										<span class="p">Even if a person is not eligible to make a request for official information under the OIA (for example a person who is overseas and not a New Zealand citizen or resident), they can still ask an agency for the information they are seeking.</span>

										<span class="p">While the agency is not required to respond in accordance with the requirements of the OIA, it should still deal with the request for information in an administratively reasonable manner. If the person still has any concerns about the response that they receive, then they can complain to the Ombudsman under the [OIA].</span>
									</span>
								</span>
							</span>
						</p>

						<p>If you're not eligible yourself, there's nothing stopping you from asking someone who <em>is</em> eligible to make the request on your behalf.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="expander js-expander">
					<h3 class="expander__trigger js-expander-trigger" id="prepare-what">What can I ask for?</h3>

					<div class="expander__body js-expander-body">
						<p>Almost all information held by a government agency can be requested under the OIA. If you want to know specifically what does and doesn't count as "official information", <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/whole.html#DLM64790" target="_blank">section 2</a> of the OIA goes into all the legal detail. It's perhaps easier to give a summary of what you <em>can't</em> ask for:</p>

						<h4>You can't ask for an agency's opinion on an issue</h4>

						<p>This gets interpreted as a request to create information, which isn't covered under the OIA. However, you could ask for documents or internal communications about the issue that interests you.</p>

						<h4>You can't ask for information about yourself under the OIA</h4>

						<p>That's not to say you can't ask for this information &mdash; you can &mdash; but it's covered under the <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0028/latest/DLM296639.html" target="_blank">Privacy Act</a> instead. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner has an online tool called <a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/further-resources/aboutme-request-my-info-tool/" target="_blank">AboutMe</a> to help you make these requests.</p>

						<h4>Information likely to cause harm will be withheld</h4>

						<p><a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/whole.html#DLM65366" target="_blank">Section 6</a> of the OIA lays out several good reasons for withholding information, with a focus on preventing harm. You can read this section of the OIA itself for specifics.</p>

						<p>Basically, it says that there's a good reason to withhold information if it would be likely to harm national security, international relations, maintenance of the law, or someone's personal safety.</p>

						<p>It also says information about changes to economic policies shouldn't be released prematurely under the OIA if that would be likely to seriously harm the economy.</p>

						<h4>Information expected to be confidential will probably be withheld</h4>

						<p><a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/whole.html#DLM65371" target="_blank">Section 9</a> of the OIA lays out various other reasons withholding information, many of which have a focus on expectations of confidentiality.</p>

						<p>For example, information can be withheld if it's necessary to protect someone's privacy, or a trade secret. You're likely to see parts of documents withheld for these reasons, for example if you asked for correspondence an agency received about a certain topic then they'd be likely to withhold the names and contact details of people involved.</p>

						<p>The reasons for withholding information under <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/whole.html#DLM65371" target="_blank">section 9</a> can be overridden if there is sufficient public interest in the information being released.</p>

						<p>Unfortunately, it's not super clear from the OIA alone just what some of the parts of <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/whole.html#DLM65371" target="_blank">section 9</a> mean. If you're unsure what a particular clause means, have a look at the list of <a href="http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/resources-and-publications/guides/official-information-legislation-guides" target="_blank">guidance notes</a> published by the Ombudsman. There's probably one that explains how the section you're wondering about should be applied.</p>

						<h4>If in doubt, ask.</h4>

						<p>The worst case scenario is that they say no.</p>

				<div class="expander js-expander">
					<h3 class="expander__trigger js-expander-trigger" id="prepare-who">Who do I ask?</h3>

					<div class="expander__body js-expander-body">
						<p>One of the most important things in making a request is directing your question to the right place. This depends heavily on what you're asking for.</p>

						<p>If you don't ask the right agency, your request might be delayed because they have to transfer it to an agency that can help you. Or they might refuse your request because they don't hold the information you're looking for.</p>

						<p>If you're not sure which agency to ask, the website <a href="https://fyi.org.nz/" target="_blank">FYI.org.nz</a> has a list of agencies you can search through. It also has a list of the <a href="https://fyi.org.nz/body/list/popular_agency" target="_blank">most popular agencies</a>.</p>

						<p>Keep in mind that ministers and the agencies they oversee, e.g. the Minister of Justice and the Ministry of Justice, are separate entities. Unless you are asking for information specific to the minister, such as advice they have received, your request should be directed to the agency.</p>

						<p>There are some public bodies that are not covered by the OIA. If you can't find an agency on FYI's list, they might fall under this category. You can still ask them for information, but they aren't bound by the rules of the OIA.</p>

						<p>Local government bodies are covered by the LGOIMA rather than the OIA. Generally, the two laws work the same, so this guide should still be useful to you.</p>

					<h3 class="expander__trigger js-expander-trigger" id="prepare-how">How do I ask?</h3>

					<div class="expander__body js-expander-body">
						<p>My favourite way to make OIA requests is using the website <a href="https://fyi.org.nz/" target="_blank">FYI.org.nz</a>. When you make a request there, FYI handles the email correspondence between you and the agency, and keeps your request public so anyone can see what you've requested and how the agency has responded.</p>

						<p>It's not the only way you can make a request though. In fact,

								</span>
							</span>
						</p>

						<p>This means that <em>any request for information received by a government agency is an OIA request</em>. No matter what form it came in, the agency is obliged to abide by the OIA.</p>

						<p>
							Being able to make requests in any way means you can make them via email, phone, and

									<span class="blockquote">
										Any agency that has an email address can receive a request via FYI, and agencies that have a Twitter account or Facebook page can receive requests in that way.
									</span>
								</span>
							</span>
							But there's a pitfall to be wary of here. Make sure you are directing your request to an address operated by the agency in its official capacity.
						</p>

						<p>
							This comes up most often when making requests of ministers, because they also have other roles such as being a member of a political party. If your request goes to an email or

								<span class="tooltip__trigger" id="tooltip-social-media-party-trigger">social media account operated by their political party</span>,
								<span class="tooltip__body" id="tooltip-social-media-party-body">
									<span class="p">For example, in early 2017 I <a href="https://twitter.com/HonestUniverse/status/828430952711876608" target="_blank">sent an OIA request via Twitter</a> to the account @pmbillenglish, which was operated by the Prime Minister at the time, Bill English.</span>

									<span class="p">It seemed pretty clear to me at the time that the account was operated in Mr English's official capacity as Prime Minister. However, I was later informed that the account was actually operated by the Office of the Leader of the National Party.</span>

									<span class="p">With the Leader of the National Party and the Prime Minister being the same people at the time, this may seem like splitting hairs. But when I followed up by inquiring with the Office of the Ombudsman they agreed with what I had been told.</span>

									<span class="p">Here is an extract from the general guidance they sent me on the matter:</span>

									<span class="blockquote">
										<span class="p">it may be arguable that a Minister has not designated a Twitter account or Facebook page for the purpose of receiving electronic communications in their capacity as Minister, and therefore, such communications will not be taken to be received until they come to the Minister’s attention. As there may be no guarantee when this will be, requesters may prefer to use officially designated channels for ministerial communication (see <a href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/" target="_blank">www.beehive.govt.nz</a>).</span>
									</span>
								</span>
							</span>
							rather than the minister's office, then it won't count.
						</p>

						<p>You should be able to find an appropriate email address on the agency's website. If you can't find a dedicated OIA email address listed, you can send it to a general one. The email addresses for ministers can be found on <a href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/" target="_blank">www.beehive.govt.nz</a>.</p>

						<p>If your request was made orally, agencies can <em>request</em> that you put it in writing. You don't need to do this &mdash; if you don't, they still have to answer your request &mdash; but it's likely a good idea to help them give you the information you're after.</p>

						<p>Before you write a request, have a search for the information you're looking for. It's possible that it's already available online, in which case you could have saved yourself a month of waiting.</p>

						<p>As well as searching the agency's website, it can be useful to search the requests already made on <a href="https://fyi.org.nz/" target="_blank">FYI.org.nz</a>.</p>

								<span class="tooltip__body" id="tooltip-decision-meaning-body">
									<span class="p">Making a decision on your request can mean anything from giving you the information you asked for, deciding to withhold all or some of it, or transferring you to a different agency. It can also mean deciding to extend the time limit.</span>
								</span>
							</span>
							and tell you about it "as soon as reasonably practicable", and certainly no later than 20 working days after receiving the request.
						</p>

						<p>Some agencies, like Statistics New Zealand, are typically really good at responding quickly. Unfortunately this is an exception; most agencies are fairly likely to take the full 20 working days.</p>

						<p>It is possible for agencies to extend the time limit past 20 working days. <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/whole.html#DLM65394" target="_blank">Section 15A</a> of the OIA says they can do this if it's necessary because the information you've asked for takes a long time to retrieve, or if they need to make consultations before they can respond and they can't do this within the standard time limit.</p>

						<p>If an agency wants to extend this time limit, they have to tell you that before the standard 20 working days is up. They also have to tell you the reason why they're extending it. Unfortunately, this explanation typically comes in the vague form of saying it's necessary for them to be able to make the necessary consultations.</p>

					<div class="expander__body js-expander-body">
						<p>Agencies are not allowed to require you to make your request via another method, but it sometimes happens. For example, NZ Police have told people making requests via FYI that they must visit a police station to make a request in person, or fill out a particular form.</p>

						<p><em>This is unlawful</em>. It is the agency's responsibility to make sure your request is handled appropriately regardless of how they received it.</p>

						<p>If it's straightforward, such as emailing your request to a different address, it may be easier to do as they've asked instead of fighting it. Regardless, you should inform them that <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/whole.html#DLM65382" target="_blank">section 12(1AA)(a)</a> of the OIA says requests <q>may be made in any form and communicated by any means</q>.</p>

						<p>The 20 working days' deadline for them to reply to your request is set from when they originally received it. If it takes a week before you make your request again in the way they asked, that wouldn't change the deadline they have to abide by.</p>

						<p>Depending on how you've made your request, and if you've had contact with the agency in the past, some agencies will ask for proof of eligibility under the OIA before they will process your request. Often, they will ask for your address to prove you are in New Zealand.</p>

						<p>Unfortunately, this is often used as a tactic by some agencies to delay or block requests. Having a government authority demand private information can be intimidating.</p>

						<p>You don't need to provide any information you don't want to, though an agency may refuse to fulfil your request if they can't establish eligibility. This isn't usually an issue with most agencies, but some (such as NZ Police) are more likely to ask for proof of eligibility.</p>

It notes that, if a request is refused because the information is publicly available:</span>

						<p>If it will be publicly available soon, the agency has to tell you when they expect it to be available, and they also have to contact you when it becomes available.</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Releasing the information to requestors as soon as reasonably practicable particularly where no harm or prejudice has been identified in the release of the information;</li>

								<li>Providing requestors with a specific date (or a date by which) it is expected that the information will be released; and</li>

					<h3 class="expander__trigger js-expander-trigger" id="wrong-withheld">Information has been withheld</h3>

					<div class="expander__body js-expander-body">
						<p>When you do get a response, you may find that some or all of the information you requested has been withheld. The agency has to tell you why each piece of information has been withheld, and different information may have been withheld under different grounds.</p>

						<h4 id="wrong-withheld-why">Why was it withheld?</h4>

						<p>When you get a response like this, especially if they've specified the section of the OIA the information was withheld under without much explanation of what that means, it's best to check the relevant section of the OIA yourself. For example, <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/whole.html#DLM65371" target="_blank">section 9(2)(a)</a> allows information to be withheld in order to protect privacy.</p>

						<p>If you don't think the agency is justified in having withheld that information under those grounds, or if the relevant section of the OIA doesn't seem clear on its own, you should next have a look at the list of <a href="http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/resources-and-publications/guides/official-information-legislation-guides" target="_blank">guidance notes</a> produced by the Ombudsman. There's probably a note directly relevant to the section that's been cited in your case, and the guidance notes can help you understand if the decision was fully justified.</p>

						<h4 id="wrong-withheld-challenging">Challenging the decision</h4>

						<p>If you think the information shouldn't have been withheld, or even if you're not sure (it can be hard to tell sometimes, without seeing the information) and don't trust that the agency has made the right decision, the next step is to lay a complaint to the Ombudsman.</p>

						<p>The Ombudsman will investigate your complaint, and they are allowed to look at information that has been withheld in order to determine if the decision to withhold it was justified.</p>

						<p>If they agree with you that the information should not have been withheld, they will make a recommendation to the agency. The agency should then take steps to make the information available to you.</p>

						<p>In your complaint, you should outline what's happened and why you disagree with the decision.</p>

						<p>One useful way to challenge these decisions is if you believe the agency hasn't adequately considered the public interest aspect of releasing the information. The provisions for withholding information laid out in <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/whole.html#DLM65371" target="_blank">section 9</a> of the OIA can be overridden if it is in the public interest for the information to be released.</p>

						<p>It's also important to understand that <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/whole.html#DLM65371" target="_blank">section 9</a> only allows for information to be withheld if it's <em>necessary</em> for the given purpose, such as protecting privacy. If you believe it wasn't <em>necessary</em> for the agency to withhold that information, you can challenge the decision on those grounds.</p>

						<p>For example, if they've withheld the author of a report but it's public knowledge who the report's author is, it was not <em>necessary</em> for them to withhold that information.</p>

						<p>You should attach a zip file to your complaint, containing all the correspondence you've had with the agency about your request. Make sure you also include any attachments that the agency sent to you.</p>

						<p>Complaints to the Ombudsman should be emailed to <a href="mailto:info@ombudsman.parliament.nz">info@ombudsman.parliament.nz</a>, or you can <a href="http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/make-a-complaint/make-a-complaint-now/make-a-complaint-online-now" target="_blank">fill out a form</a> on their website.</p>

						<p>An Ombudsman complaint is a much slower process than an OIA request, so be prepared for it to take months to be resolved. In the meantime, you may want to think about what related information you might be able to request from the agency, or from a different agency.</p>
